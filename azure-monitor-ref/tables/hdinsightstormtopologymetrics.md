## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Acked | real | The number of Tuple “trees” successfully processed. A value of 0 is expected if no acking is done. |
| AssignedCPUPercent | real | Percent of CPU cores assigned to the topology. |
| AssignedMemOffHeapMB | real | MB of off heap memory assigned to the topology. |
| AssignedMemOnHeapMB | real | MB of on heap memory assigned to the topology. |
| AssignedTotalMemMB | real | MB of total memory assigned to the topology. |
| _BilledSize | real | The record size in bytes |
| BoltId | string | The ID of the bolt. |
| Capacity | real | If this is around 1.0, the corresponding Bolt is running as fast as it can, so you may want to increase the Bolt’s parallelism. This is (number executed * average execute latency) / measurement time. |
| ClusterName | string | The name of the cluster. |
| ClusterType | string | The type of the cluster. |
| CompleteLatencyMs | real | The average time (millisecond) a Tuple “tree” takes to be completely processed by the Topology. A value of 0 is expected if no acking is done. |
| CorrelationId | string | The ID for correlated events. Can be used to identify correlated events between multiple tables. |
| Debug | bool | Boolean representing whether debug tracing is activated. |
| Emitted | real | The number of Tuples emitted. |
| EncodedBoltId | string | The encoded ID of the bolt. |
| EncodedId | string | The enocded ID of the topology. |
| EncodedSpoutId | string | The encoded ID of the Spout. |
| ErrorHost | string | Host where the error occurred. |
| ErrorPort | string | Port associated with the error. |
| ErrorWorkerLogLink | string | Link to the log of the worker where an error occurred. |
| Executed | real |  The number of incoming Tuples processed. |
| ExecuteLatencyMs | real | The average time (millisecond) a Tuple spends in the execute method. The execute method may complete without sending an Ack for the tuple. |
| Executors | int | The number of threads being used to execute a task. |
| ExecutorsTotal | int | The total amount of executors currently used and already used to execute a task. |
| Failed | real | The number of Tuple “trees” that were explicitly failed or timed out before acking was completed. A value of 0 is expected if no acking is done. |
| HostName | string | Hostname of the host the record came from. |
| Id | string | The name of the component the record is from (could be spout, bolt, or name of topology). |
| InstanceName | string | Type of record shape (there are bolt, spout, topology, and topology_stats record shapes). |
| _IsBillable | string | Specifies whether ingesting the data is billable. When _IsBillable is `false` ingestion isn't billed to your Azure account |
| LastError | string | Last error to occur in the component. |
| MsgTimeout | real | The number of seconds until a message times out. |
| OperationName | string | The operation associated with log record. |
| Owner | string | Name of the user that owns the topology. |
| ProcessLatencyMs | real | The average time (millisecond) it takes to Ack a Tuple after it is first received. Bolts that join, aggregate or batch may not Ack a tuple until a number of other Tuples have been received(. |
| ReplicationCount | int | The amount of replicas kept by the topology. |
| RequestedCpuPercent | real | The percent of CPU requested by the topology. |
| RequestMemOffHeapMB | real | MB of off heap memory requested by the topology. |
| RequestMemOnHeapMB | real | MB of on heap memory requested by the topology. |
| _ResourceId | string | A unique identifier for the resource that the record is associated with |
| SamplingPct | real | Percentage of messages sampled to calculate metrics. |
| SchedulerDisplayResource | bool | Boolean describing the scheduler display setting. |
| SourceSystem | string | The type of agent the event was collected by. For example, `OpsManager` for Windows agent, either direct connect or Operations Manager, `Linux` for all Linux agents, or `Azure` for Azure Diagnostics |
| SpoutId | string | The ID of the spout. |
| Status | string | The status of the topology. |
| _SubscriptionId | string | A unique identifier for the subscription that the record is associated with |
| Tasks | int | The number of tasks running. |
| TasksTotal | int | The total amount of tasks run. |
| TenantId | string | The Log Analytics workspace ID |
| TimeGenerated | datetime | The timestamp (UTC) of when the log was generated. |
| TopologyId | string | The ID of the topology. |
| TopologyName | string | Name of the topology. |
| Transferred | real | The number of Tuples emitted that sent to one or more bolts. |
| Type | string | The name of the table |
| Uptime | string | The length of time an Executor (thread) has been alive. |
| UptimeSeconds | real | The amount of time the topology has been running in seconds. |
| Window | real | The time window for the metrics in the record in seconds. |
| WindowHint | string | The time window for the metrics in the record in hours, minutes, seconds format. |
| WindowPretty | string | String description of the time window for the metrics in the record. |
| Workers | string | JSON with worker specific metrics. |
| WorkersTotal | int | The total amount of workers. |
