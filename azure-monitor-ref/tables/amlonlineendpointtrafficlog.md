# AmlOnlineEndpointTrafficLog

Traffic logs for AzureML (machine learning) online endpoints. The table could be used to check the detailed information of the request to an online endpoint. For example, you could use it to check the request duration, the request failure reason, etc.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| AuthType | string | The authentication type of the request (Key, AMLToken, AADToken). |
| AzureMLWorkspaceId | string | The machine learning workspace ID of the online endpoint. |
| AzureMLWorkspaceName | string | The machine learning workspace name of the online endpoint. |
| _BilledSize | real | The record size in bytes |
| DeploymentName | string | The name of the online deployment. |
| EndpointName | string | The name of the online endpoint. |
| IdentityData | string | The identity data from the user client (JWT OID). |
| _IsBillable | string | Specifies whether ingesting the data is billable. When _IsBillable is `false` ingestion isn't billed to your Azure account |
| Location | string | The region of the online endpoint. |
| Method | string | The requested method from client. |
| ModelStatusCode | int | The response status code from model. |
| ModelStatusReason | string | The response status reason from model. |
| OperationName | string | The operation associated with log record. |
| Path | string | The requested path from client. |
| Protocol | string | The protocol of the request. |
| RequestDurationMs | int | Duration in milliseconds from the request start time to the last byte of the request received from the user client. |
| RequestPayloadSize | int | The total bytes received from the user client. |
| RequestThrottlingDelayMs | int | Delay in milliseconds in request data transfer due to network throttling. |
| _ResourceId | string | A unique identifier for the resource that the record is associated with |
| ResponseCode | int | The final response code returned to the user. |
| ResponseCodeReason | string | The final response code reason returned to the user. |
| ResponseDurationMs | int | Duration in milliseconds from the request start time to the first response byte read from the model. |
| ResponsePayloadSize | int | The total bytes sent back to the user client. |
| ResponseThrottlingDelayMs | int | Delay in milliseconds in response data transfer due to network throttling. |
| SourceSystem | string | The type of agent the event was collected by. For example, `OpsManager` for Windows agent, either direct connect or Operations Manager, `Linux` for all Linux agents, or `Azure` for Azure Diagnostics |
| _SubscriptionId | string | A unique identifier for the subscription that the record is associated with |
| TenantId | string | The Log Analytics workspace ID |
| TimeGenerated | datetime | The timestamp (UTC) of when the request was received by Azure Machine Learning. |
| TotalDurationMs | int | Duration in milliseconds from the request start time to the last response byte sent back to the user client. If the user client disconnected, it measures from the start time to client disconnect time. |
| Type | string | The name of the table |
| UserAgent | string | The user-agent header of the request. |
| XMSClientRequestId | string | The tracking ID generated by user client. |
| XRequestId | string | The request ID generated by Azure Machine Learning for internal tracing. |
