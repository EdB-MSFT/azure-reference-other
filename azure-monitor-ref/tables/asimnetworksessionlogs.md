As we can see from the diagram above, the receiver sends an ACK as well as a SYN in the second step of the three way handshake process to tell the sender that it received its initial packet. |
| TcpFlagsFin | bool | The TCP FIN flag reported. The finished flag means there is no more data from the sender. Therefore, it is used in the last packet sent from the sender. |

| TcpFlagsRst | bool | The TCP RST flag reported. The reset flag gets sent from the receiver to the sender when a packet is sent to a particular host that was not expecting it. |
| TcpFlagsSyn | bool | The TCP SYN flag reported. The synchronisation flag is used as a first step in establishing a three way handshake between two hosts. Only the first packet from both the sender and receiver should have this flag set. |
| TcpFlagsUrg | bool | The TCP URG flag reported. The urgent flag is used to notify the receiver to process the urgent packets before processing all other packets. The receiver will be notified when all known urgent data has been received. See RFC 6093 for more details. |
| TenantId | string | The Log Analytics workspace ID |
| ThreatCategory | string | The category of the threat or malware identified in the network session. |
| ThreatConfidence | int | The confidence level of the threat identified, normalized to a value between 0 and a 100. |

| ThreatFirstReportedTime | datetime | The first time the IP address or domain were identified as a threat. |
| ThreatId | string | The ID of the threat or malware identified in the network session. |
| ThreatIpAddr | string | An IP address for which a threat was identified. The field ThreatField contains the name of the field ThreatIpAddr represents. |
| ThreatIsActive | bool | True ID the threat identified is considered an active threat. |
| ThreatLastReportedTime | datetime | The last time the IP address or domain were identified as a threat. |
| ThreatName | string | The name of the threat or malware identified in the network session. |
| ThreatOriginalConfidence | string | The original confidence level of the threat identified, as reported by the reporting device. |
| ThreatOriginalRiskLevel | string | The risk level as reported by the reporting device. |
| ThreatRiskLevel | int | The risk level associated with the session. The level is a number between 0 to 100. |
